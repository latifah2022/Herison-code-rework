The codebase that follows accessibility standards
so my own site is optimized for search engines.

 And it meets the acceptance criteria;

WHEN I view the source code,

THEN I find semantic HTML elements.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements,

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

WHEN I view the image elements,

THEN I find accessible alt attributes.

WHEN I view the heading attributes,

THEN they fall in sequential order.

WHEN I view the title element,

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title. 

Was able to leave the code alot cleaner than i left it.
